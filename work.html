    <h1>Pick 'n Save | Bagger | 2018–2019</h1>
    <p>
        My first job was as a bagger at Pick 'n Save. I assisted customers, bagged groceries,
        brought carts inside, and kept the front area clean. This job helped me build a strong
        work ethic and taught me the value of responsibility, saving, and hard work.

    <h1>Hideaway Bar & Grill | Barback | Summers 2020 & 2021</h1>
    <p>
        After Pick 'n Save was unable to offer additional hours, I began working as a barback at
        Hideaway Bar & Grill. I worked 30–40 hours per week during the summer, supporting bartenders,
        restocking supplies, and keeping the workspace organized in a fast-paced environment.

        Domino’s. This position strengthened my customer service, time management, and navigation
        skills while balancing my final semester.
