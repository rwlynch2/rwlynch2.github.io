    <h1>About Me</h1><img src = "selfie.jpeg" alt="Photo of me in Alaska hicking" width="300">
    <p>Hello!  </p>
    <p>My name is Ryan Lynch, and I graduated in May 2024 from the University of Wisconsin–Madison with a degree in Computer Engineering and a double major in Computer Sciences.</p>

    <p>I currently work as a Controls Engineer at Rockwell Automation, where I develop and maintain automated test environments and ensure testware remains reliable and operational.</p>

    <p>Outside of work, I enjoy gaming, working out, building and upgrading PCs, and traveling. Recently I've been playing Valorant, Elden Ring, and Deadlock on both PC and PS5.</p>

    <p>The photo above was taken at the start of a glacier hike in Alaska—one of my favorite trips so far.</p>
